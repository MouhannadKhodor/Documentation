# Version Control & Git

* **Version Control**: is a way to keep track of your files at different points in time. Using it is like having a giant UNDO button for your project. It solves a problem that might look familiar if youâ€™ve ever seen documents with names like Report_2014_1.doc, Report_2014_2.doc, Report_2014_3.doc, or budget-v7.xls to keep track of your different versions. 

* Fluency in at least one version control system is an essential skill for a developer, designer, and manager alike.
 
* There are many systems out there like RCS, CVS, and Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and Mercurial. Here we use the most popular open source one: Git!

* **Git**: was developed by Linux creator Linus Torvalds to host the Linux kernel. It is a command-line program that is designed in the Unix tradition. That is why you need to have knowledge of how to use the Unix-style commmand line.
