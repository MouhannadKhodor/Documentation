# GNU/Linux

You will install Linux on your systems

## Goals

  - Learn how to install Linux
  - Edit configuration files
  - **Competencies**:
    - <kbd>Linux</kbd> 
    - <kbd>Configuration files</kbd>
    - <kbd>Sysadmin</kbd> 

## Step 1

Document yourself about Linux. See what it is, how it works.

In particular, read about:

- what's a "distribution" ("distro")
- what's a "window manager", a "desktop environment"
- what's GNU

But also everything else you can find.

Then;

## Step 2

Install Linux

For any installation to be considered valid, after the main system, you need the following software:

- A Graphical User Interface (like Gnome or KDE)
- Git
- SSH
- Node.JS And NPM
- Vim / or NeoVIM
- Visual Studio Code (Visual Studio Code)
- One mainstream browser (Firefox, Chromium, Chrome, ...)

Depending on your distro, a certain amount of that software might come for free. For example, in any of the "mainstream" distributions, you get a GUI by default.


For each installation of a significantly different flavor of Linux, you will accrue points

- A mainstream distribution with a graphical installed (Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint, ...) is ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘
- Another mainstream distribution is ðŸ”‘
- A raw distribution (Arch, Gentoo, LFS, ...) is ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘
- Another raw distribution is ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘

Additionally:

- installing at least one mainstream and one raw is ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘ bonus
- any one PC without a working system (with a graphical interface) is MINUS ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘ðŸ”‘
