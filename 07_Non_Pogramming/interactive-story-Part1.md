# Choose Your Own Adventure Design

You will design an interactive story.

Examples of interactive stories

- https://www.choiceofgames.com/category/our-games/
- https://chooseyourstory.com/

You will *design* create such a story.

You are *not* asked to implement it.

## Goals

  - learn to design a graph
  - learn to write a story
  - learn to distribute tasks
  - **Competencies**:
    - <kbd>project management</kbd>
    - <kbd>git</kbd>
    - <kbd>html</kbd>
    - <kbd>css</kbd> 


## Requirements

- There will be *at least* 5 branches
- There will be *at least* two endings (one of them can be a game over)
- There will be *at least* one variable that changes a later outcome (an item picked up, health points, time...)
- There will be *at least* 2 illustrations in the whole game


## Instructions

- fork this repo to your team's page ğŸ”‘
- clone it on one of your laptops
- Your team will produce:
  - the graph of the story (what leads where) ğŸ”‘ğŸ”‘ğŸ”‘
  - the texts ğŸ”‘ğŸ”‘ğŸ”‘
  - the images ğŸ”‘ğŸ”‘ğŸ”‘
  - an example, with html and css, of one page ğŸ”‘ğŸ”‘ğŸ”‘
  - a readme.md that explains all of that, and your intention ğŸ”‘ğŸ”‘
- When you're done, push it back ğŸ”‘x16

## Bonus

Depending on the quality of the work you may obtain an additional ğŸ”‘x1 to ğŸ”‘x100 points. You will be - subjectively - noted on:

- quality of the graph (how clear, how pleasant to read)
- quality of the story
- quality of the writing
- quality of the variables (how creative)
- quality of the images (produced or sourced)
